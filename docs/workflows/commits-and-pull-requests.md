# Making commits and creating pull requests

We are following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format. The reasoning is captured in the ADR [here](../adr/0003-conventional-commits.md)

For pull requests, we will follow a feature branch model with single trunk called `master`. All the changes need to go through pull request.
