# Create a New Component

Take the following steps to create a new component in `src/components`

- create the component directory
- run `yarn init -y` and verify the created `package.json` file
- take minimal code from other components including `cdk.json` and `core` and `infra` packages
- add scripts in `package.json`
- test the setup by running `yarn synth`
