# Common Infra

This component is responsible for two things: - bootstrap cdk to a new aws env - holds the code for common infrastructure which cut across more than one component

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `yarn build` compile typescript to js
- `yarn watch` watch for changes and compile
- `yarn test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
